<p>I'm fairly new to JavaScript so a few months ago I put together a small project that would help me learn how, in particular, arrays work. The result was a random string generator that pulls values from inside an array.</p>

<p>You can view the result here at <a href="http://wilks.co/labs/nq-bar-generator" title="Northern Quarter Bar Generator" target="_blank">Northern Quarter Bar Generator</a></p>

<p>I plan to expand it's functionality over the next few weeks with more location based features as-well as simple things like links to the websites of the bars.</p>

<p>If you have anything you'd like to see added feel free to leave a comment!</p>
