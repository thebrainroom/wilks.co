I'm fairly new to JavaScript so a few months ago I put together a small project that would help me learn how, in particular, arrays work. The result was a random string generator that pulls values from inside an array.

You can view the result here at [Northern Quarter Bar Generator](/labs/nq-bar-generator)

I plan to expand it's functionality over the next few weeks with more location based features as-well as simple things like links to the websites of the bars.

If you have anything you'd like to see added feel free to leave a comment!
