intro: Hi there, I'm Tom and I'm a Web Developer from Manchester focusing on front-end and Drupal development. I've been developing websites commercially since 2010 and dabbling in all things web since 2005.

I've worked with companies such as Channel 4, BooHoo, Royal Bank of Scotland, Umbro, Schwarzkpf and a large chunk of the UK tourism sector.

My skills currently cross many fields but you could consider me an expert in Front End and Drupal development. I've had the pleasure of being able to grow with both these technilogies in my 15 years of web development experience.

As you'd expect a front end developer to be, I'm highly experienced with HTML, vanilla CSS and JavaScript along with a plethora of productivity tools such as Sass, PostCSS, Gulp and many others.
